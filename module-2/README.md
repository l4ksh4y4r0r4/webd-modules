# Module 2: Fetch APIs and DOM Manipulation Assignment

## Objective
In this module, you'll create a web application that fetches and displays GitHub user data using the GitHub API. The aim is to learn how to work with Fetch APIs, handle JSON responses, and manipulate the DOM to build a dynamic user interface.

---

## Assignment Details

### Requirements
1. Create a user-friendly web application where users can input a GitHub username to view details such as:
   - Public repositories
   - Number of followers
   - Number of following
   - Profile picture and bio (if available)
2. Use **fetch()** in JavaScript to fetch data from the GitHub API.
3. Handle errors gracefully (e.g., if a user enters an invalid username or if there's a network issue).
4. Push your code to GitHub and ensure the repository is public.
5. Deploy your web application using **GitHub Pages**, **Netlify**, **Vercel**, or any deployment server of your choice.

### EXTRA Brownie Points
- Make the design **responsive** for all screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- Experiment with **CSS Flexbox** and **media queries** to achieve responsiveness.
- Add animations or styling to enhance the user experience.
